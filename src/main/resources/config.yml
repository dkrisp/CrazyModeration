# Few things to know before editing language files:
# - To colorize your messages, you need to use the color code,
#   which starts with the symbol "&" and ends with a letter or
#   a number. For example, "&a" will colorize your message in
#   green. You can find all the color codes here: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
#
#   Notice: All the messages are written in the folder "language"
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{player}" to replace the name
#   of the player in your messages.
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{reason}" to replace the reason
#   of the player in your messages.
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{time}" to replace the time
#   of the player in your messages.
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{punishment_type}" to replace the
#   punishment of the player in your messages.
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{punishment_id}" to replace the
#   punishment id of the player in your messages
#
# - You can use the placeholder "{punisher}" to replace the
#   punishment punisher of the player in your messages.
